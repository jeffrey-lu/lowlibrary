  <p class="lead">
    Low Memorial Library, built in 1897, overlooks Columbia University and serves as the unofficial symbol of campus. It continues to play a vital part in University life as an administrative center.</p>

<h1>History</h1>
<p>Columbia University, by 1897, had moved three times before finally settling into the Morningside Heights campus it currently occupies. Low Library was the first structure built on the grounds, originally intended to be the main campus library. However, it only served this purpose until 1934, when it was replaced by Butler Library, which sits directly across the campus grounds. The structure of Low Library made it difficult to move books into the building, and the main areas were unsuited for reading rooms or study areas, so the University concluded that it would function better a center for administration.</p>
<br />
<h1>External Design</h1>
<p>Low Library was designed in the neoclassical style of architecture, which was very common during the late 19th Century in the United States. Standing at 106 feet tall, the building’s rotunda, originally the Library’s main reading room, is capped by the world’s largest free-standing granite dome. The southern façade is dominated by ten ionic-order columns, reminiscent of the design of Rome’s Pantheon. The frieze layer above the columns reads “The Library of Columbia University,” stating its original purpose on campus. On the left and right sides of the frieze are two numbers in Roman Numerals – the number to the left, MDCCLIV (1754), denotes the year that Columbia University was founded. The number to the right, MDCCCXCVII (1897), denotes the year that Low Library was completed. Inscribed in the pediment is a brief description of the history and mission of Columbia University. </p>
<p> Above the pediment layer is the dome of the Library, which is divided into two layers. The first layer that protrudes above the building itself is in the shape of a cross, with one large round-arched window facing each of the four cardinal directions. At the top of the first layer are a variety of decorations. Above the first layer is the dome itself, which is surrounded by a railing and textured with a scale-like appearance at the top. The entire building is grayish white in appearance, made from granite and concrete.</p>
<p>The eastern and western sides of Low Library are largely the same, featuring four stories of windows. The bottom windows are near street level, with two stories of windows right above and then another layer of windows separated by a horizontal divider. Each vertical column of windows is divided by vertical bars connecting the top and bottom horizontal dividers, resembling columns. The north side of the library is very different from the south side and resembles more closely the eastern and western sides. The middle five windows of the northern side are similarly separated by vertical dividers, although the top windows are significantly larger than the lower ones, and the layer above the top horizontal divider has no windows. Looking at the building from above, the bottom portion of Low Library resembles a Greek cross. The first raised portion is in the same shape, and the circular dome sits on the top. </p>
<p>The Library is made largely of concrete, and the grayish-white tone of the outside reflects the architectural work of the Greeks and Romans. This is consistent with the time period in American history that many call the American Renaissance, which was characterized by a strong nationalistic belief that the United States was the heir to the greatness of the Roman and Greek empires. Low Library bears a strong resemblance to the Pantheon in Rome, which was constructed under the reign of Augustus as a temple to the Gods. The design of the Library, along with its elevated setting above the plaza and College Walk, exudes a sentiment of grandeur. Visitors’ eyes are drawn to the Library upon entry into the center of campus, an effect that is compounded by the powerful architecture of the building and the clear distinction between it and the rest of Columbia’s buildings.

<h1>Interior Design</h1>
<p>The rotunda is the largest and most prominent room in Low Library, having served originally as the main reading room. It now serves as the principal ceremonial space on campus, hosting major prize ceremonies like the Pulitzers, as well as the World Leaders Forum series featuring heads of state from around the world. Along the four sides of the rotunda are four sets of four ionic-order columns, each set located directly under the semi-circle windows of the Library. The columns themselves are made of green marble with golden capitals. The frieze layer features carvings of wreaths above each of columns, and above them stand pedestals for statues. However, only the four statues on the Northern side were ever actually erected. They depict Euripedes, Demosthenes, Sophocles, and Augustus Caesar, and are all carved from marble. Around the other parts of the rotunda are many reminders of the original intended purpose of the Library, including carvings of areas of study and of great people from history. This is a theme consistent throughout Columbia University, and many buildings feature names in the frieze layers. Butler Library is likely the most prominent example after Low, with the names of a variety of philosophers carved into the frieze.</p>
